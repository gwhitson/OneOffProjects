EasyTUI!
a simple python library for creating simple TUI applications

currently intended for single pane applications and just keyboard input
To handle keyboard input, I am modifying code found on the following stack overflow thread:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13207678/whats-the-simplest-way-of-detecting-keyboard-input-in-a-script-from-the-termina
The post from user LouYu held the base key_getter.py file which I then modified to suit my needs.
